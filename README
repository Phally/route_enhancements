RouteEnhancement plugin for CakePHP 1.3

This plugin packs two custom Route classes designed to work with GET parameters and other legacy urls.

The first class (QueryStringParseRoute) is a class to parse and route on GET parameters. The second class
is the RedirectRoute, a route designed to redirect before Controllers are constructed, etc. The
RedirectRoute extends the QueryStringParseRoute, so you can use those options too with the RedirectRoute.

You will probably only need/use the RedirectRoute.
